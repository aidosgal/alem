### üöÄ How to Use

#### Backend Setup
1. The API is already integrated into your Laravel application
2. Routes are at `/api/v1/*`
3. All controllers are in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/`

#### Mobile App Development
1. Read **`MOBILE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** for overview
2. Use **`API.md`** for endpoint reference
3. Follow **`WEBSOCKET.md`** for chat implementation
4. Base URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1`

#### Testing the API
You can test endpoints using:
- Postman
- Insomnia
- cURL
- React Native app

Example cURL for login:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### üìä API Endpoints Summary

| Category | Endpoints | Auth Required |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Authentication | 5 | Partial (login/register public) |
| Profile | 6 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Vacancies | 4 | ‚ùå No (public) |
| Services | 2 | ‚ùå No (public) |
| Orders | 3 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Chat | 5 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Total** | **25 endpoints** | |

### üîÑ WebSocket Events

|-------|---------|-------------|
| MessageSent | `chat.{chatId}` | New message in chat |
| MessageRead | `chat.{chatId}` | Message marked as read |
| typing (whisper) | `chat.{chatId}` | User typing indicator |

### üì± React Native Libraries Needed

```json
{
  "axios": "^1.6.0",
  "laravel-echo": "^1.15.0",
  "pusher-js": "^8.3.0",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.19.0",
  "react-native-image-picker": "^7.0.0",
  "react-native-document-picker": "^9.0.0"
}
```

### üéØ Next Steps for Mobile Development

1. **Setup React Native project**
   - Install required dependencies
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Implement API client**
   - Create axios instance with interceptors
   - Setup token management with AsyncStorage

3. **Build Authentication Flow**
   - Login/Register screens
   - Token storage
   - Auto-login on app start

4. **Implement Features**
   - Profile management
   - Browse vacancies/services
   - View orders
   - Chat functionality

5. **Setup WebSocket**
   - Initialize Laravel Echo
   - Create Echo context provider
   - Implement chat with real-time updates

6. **Testing**
   - Test all endpoints
   - Test real-time chat
   - Test file uploads
   - Handle edge cases

### üí° Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Update your `.env` file with:
   ```env
   SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=localhost,127.0.0.1
   SESSION_DOMAIN=localhost
   ```

2. **CORS**: Ensure CORS is configured in `config/cors.php`:
   ```php
   'paths' => ['api/*', 'broadcasting/auth'],
   ```

3. **Broadcasting**: Configure Reverb settings:
   ```env
   BROADCAST_DRIVER=reverb
   REVERB_APP_ID=your-app-id
   REVERB_APP_KEY=your-app-key
   REVERB_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
   REVERB_HOST=your-domain.com
   REVERB_PORT=8080
   REVERB_SCHEME=https
   ```

4. **Storage**: Run `php artisan storage:link` to link storage

5. **File Permissions**: Ensure `storage/` is writable

### üêõ Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check token is being sent with `Bearer` prefix
- **422 Validation Error**: Check request body matches documentation
- **500 Server Error**: Check Laravel logs in `storage/logs/`
- **WebSocket not connecting**: Verify Reverb is running and configuration is correct
